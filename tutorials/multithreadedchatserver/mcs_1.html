        <h1>Multithreaded Chat Server in C and Java!</h1>
        <p>Building the server - Part 1 IN PROGRESS</p>
        <p class="author">Author: Joshua Crotts</p>
        <p class="author">Date: 2021/05/17</p>
        <p>To begin, we are going to create a GitHub repository for our project. You can do this on your own, but I
          called mine <code>Multithreaded-Chat-Server-Tutorial</code>. Once you do this, clone it to your computer
          wherever you would like, but preferably a location that you can access through the terminal easily (since
          we’ll be running a lot of commands like <code>make</code> and whatnot). </p>
        <p>Now, inside this repository folder, it will either be blank, or contain a file or two, depending on how you
          set it up. We need to create a few things:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>First, create a directory called <code>src</code>. This is where all of the C source <code>.c</code> files
            will be stored.</li>
          <li>Then, create a directory called <code>include</code>. This will be where we store all header files
            <code>.h</code>.
          </li>
          <li>Create a file called <code>.gitignore</code> (with no extension!). Because we are using GitHub, there are
            some files that we don’t want to upload to the remote repository like the executables and object files that
            are generated from compiling the program. We’ll come back to this file a bit later. </li>
          <li>Lastly, create a file called Makefile (no extension!). A makefile is essential to any large C project – it
            makes compilation and linking a breeze!</li>
        </ol>
        <p><i>Note: Some people may disagree with this file structure – keeping the source and include files separate.
            You can structure the project however you want, but this is how I like to do it.</i></p>
        <p>So, your directory should look like this:</p>
        <center><img src="mcsimages/dir1.png" /></center>
        <br />
        <p><i>Note that the gitignore file is hidden by default (that's what the period in front of the name does!).</i></p>
        <p>Open this root folder in a developer environment (that can be Vim, Visual Studio Code (VSCode), or whatever
          else – I’ll be using VSCode). Now it’s time to start coding!</p>

        <p>The first thing we’re going to actually write is the server itself. A server receives connections from
          clients and dispatches messages across them. For our purposes, the server is going to receive commands and
          messages from the client (user), and it will handle them accordingly. There’s a lot that goes into this, so
          we’ll break it down one step at a time. For now, let’s just handle getting <i>a</i> connection established.
        </p>

        Create a file called <code>server.c</code> in the <code>src</code> directory and <code>server.h</code> in the
        include directory. We’ll start off with the header file. We need a few definitions to get started: namely the
        connection IP to use, some function prototypes, and constants. Let’s just jump right into it:
        <pre class="line-numbers">
          <code class="language-clike">
        #ifndef SERVER_H
        #define SERVER_H
       
        typedef struct server_s {
          int socket_fd;   /* Socket file descriptor. */
          int flags;       /* Flags for the server.   */
        } server_t;
       
        enum SERVER_FLAGS {
            SERVER_ACTIVE = 1
        };
       
        extern server_t server;
       
        extern void server_init( void );
       
        #endif // SERVER_H
            </code>
            </pre>
        <p>The first thing we do is create a <code>typedef</code> for a server structure. This structure will hold a few
          things, such as the clients that connect, the threads that handle jobs, etc. These definitions will be made
          later, once we get there. We also include a flag variable to keep track of the status of the server. The enum
          we define is simply for bookkeeping - we can store all flags that we want to use for the server here instead
          of doing a bunch of <code>const int</code>'s or preprocessor <code>#define</code>'s. Also note that we have a
          socket "fd". fd stands for <i>file descriptor</i>. A file descriptor is a handle, so to speak, meaning that
          this integer keeps track of the socket (connection) identifier once it is established. We need this to listen
          for clients later on.</p>
        <p>We also create a variable of type <code>server_t</code> to reference in the <code>server.c</code> file.
          Global references/variables are generally frowned upon, but this is, effectively, the only way to do this in
          C. Plus, it'll be the only global we use, so it's a good compromise.</p>
        <p><code>server_init</code> will initialize the socket listener and other miscellaneous things. Let's go define
          that!</p>
          <pre class="line-numbers">
            <code class="language-clike">
          #include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;
          #include &lt;errno.h&gt;
          #include &lt;netdb.h&gt;
          #include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;
          #include &lt;signal.h&gt;
          #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
          #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
          #include &lt;string.h&gt;
          #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
          #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
          #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
          
          #include "tcpdefs.h"
          #include "server.h"
          
          static int server_create_listener( const char *server );
          
          void
          server_init( void ) {
            int socket_fd;
            socket_fd = server_create_listener( PORT );
            printf( "Socket fd: %d\n", socket_fd );
          }
          
          static int
          server_create_listener( const char *server ) {
              int socket_fd;
              if ( ( socket_fd = socket( AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0 ) ) &lt; 0 ) {
                perror( "Could not initialize socket.\n" );
                return -1;
              }
              return socket_fd;
          }
  </code></pre>
      <p>Now, I'm sure you're thinking: "Wow, that's a <i>lot</i> of additions!" Well, we're not even half of the way there, so don't get too excited just yet! The first thing we've done is included a bunch of C headers. Don't worry if you don't know where a lot of this stuff comes from - just include them for now.</p>
      <p>Next, we include our <code>server.h</code> header which is nice, but what about <code>tcpdefs.h</code>? What's that, you ask? Well, we need a way of explicitly telling our server what port to start the server on. We're going to use port 8080, which is an alternate port for HTTP. The function that we need to pass this to, strangely enough, takes in the value as a string. So, since we may need to define more things for this connection (which, by the way, is TCP-based!), we're going to store these constants and other data in a header.</p>
      <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-clike">
          #ifndef TCP_DEFS_H
          #define TCP_DEFS_H

          const char *PORT = "8080";

          #endif // TCP_DEFS_H
          </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Yep, that's all there is to that! So, just make sure to include it in your <code>server.c</code> file, and we'll get back to that.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Let's talk about that <code>server_create_listener</code> function for a moment. Recall that a server listens for connections, right? Well, we have to initialize how the server actually listens before we start the listening itself. We need to initialize what's called a socket, which is just a connection between two endpoints. This socket will use TCP - a connection-based protocol, meaning that each message to and from the server has guaranteed delivery, compared to UDP which fires packets and ignores dropped ones. Since this is a chat server, we don't want packets of data to be randomly lost! We also want to set this server up to use IPv4 addressing.</p>
          <p>To do both of these, we use the <code>socket</code> function which takes three parameters: a domain, a type, and a protocol. We want the domain to be <code>AF_INET</code>, representing IPv4 addressing. The type is <code>SOCK_STREAM</code> for TCP connectivity (or connection-oriented). The last parameter is a protocol, and you may be asking: didn't we just set a protocol for the first parameter? Yes, we did. Because that's the case, this can be set to 0. For more information, check out <code>man socket(2)</code>.</p>
          <p><i>Note: the man pages are extremely helpful for learning about Linux commands and C functions. To investigate, just type in the terminal (or google) <code>man</code> then the accompanying function.</i></p>
          <p>The <code>socket</code> function is from the <code>&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</code> header, so at least it's easy to remember! But, notice that we check its return value <i>inside</i> the <code>if</code> statement - this is a common and idiomatic way of checking C return values that need to be assigned. <code>socket()</code> returns an integer - that integer is the endpoint for the connection that we want to establish. However, if an error occurs, <code>-1</code> is returned. Thus, checking to see if the value is less than 0 is a good way to error check. This will be a common practice throughout development (especially when allocating dynamic memory!).</p>
          <br />
          <p>Let's keep going (note that I only returned/printed values in these two starter functions for demonstrative purposes).</p>
