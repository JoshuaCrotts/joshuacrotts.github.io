<I>DISCLAIMER: 
The following research projects are part of my undergraduate career at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. As such, the quality and thoroughness of the work presented here is not at the caliber of a full-time researcher or graduate student. Rather, what is presented is a short summary of what I have worked on primarily with <a href="https://www.uncg.edu/cmp/faculty/nlgreen/">Dr. Nancy L. Green</a>. Other works include those that I have done in classes or individually (these are not publishable).

Dr. Nancy L. Green and <b>Joshua Crotts</b>. July 2020.<em> Towards Automatic Detection of Antithesis.</em> University of North Carolina at Greensboro (Incomplete).
	<UL>
		<LI>Continuing the research presented at URCO, we are developing algorithms to detect the rhetorical device antithesis. Our current results are only preliminary, but expose the challenges with detecting paradoxes, contraries, contradictories, and applying real-world logic to sentences. Our focus lies with antithesis for this particular project, but we plan to reintroduce antimetabole and parison for further syntactic and semantic analysis.</LI>

	<UL>
		<LI>For the Thomas Undergradute Research Creativity Expo, I worked with Dr. Nancy L. Green on a research project focused on detecting rhetorical devices used by authors in scientific policy articles to persuade or sway the opinion of readers. We developed a graphical user interface in Python, and used the Natural Language Toolkit. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, all presentations moved to a virtual layout. Thus, in order to ensure that our work was not in vain, I recorded a narration. We are continuing this research throughout the summer of 2020.</LI>

	<UL>
		<LI>For the start of my undergraduate research experience, I worked with Dr. Nancy L. Green on a project revolving around artificial intelligence and software engineering ethics. My job was to modify a preexisting application (AVIZE) written in Java to better accomodate this new research. It is a graphical program that allows users to create argument trees with premises, conclusions, and critical questions through the use of case studies, ethical data, and argument schemes. We have since submitted a paper to CMNA 2020 (under review). This application was pilot tested in the fall 2019 semester at UNC Greensboro for her artificial intelligence ethics special-topics course (CSC-495) in the successive spring semester.</LI>

	<b>Joshua Crotts</b>. August 2020.<em> A Visual Improvement to the Pedagogy of Introductory Logic (Unpublished and Incomplete).</em>
		<UL>
			<LI><b>(Abstract)</b>: Formal logic is considered by many philosophy majors to be an arduous hurdle to overcome; exposing students to cumbersome symbols, rules, axioms, and other concepts that all resemble mathematics and computer science. Consequently, much work has gone into simplifying and abstracting the lower-level details that relate to boolean algebra/logic and discrete math. With the introduction of natural deduction and proof techniques, though, a visual aid offers a new way of understanding the textbook definitions of how a proof works under the hood, alongside the other details that form each rule used. In this research project, we explore the different methods used throughout history to decrease the difficulty curve of logic. Additionally, we display an in-progress graphical user interface program: LLAT (Learning of Logic AI Tool), which promises and hopes to provide students and educators alike a resource which compliments the traditional textbook or classroom learning style.</LI>
			<LI>Note: depending on the progress made, this may move into the undergraduate research section.</LI>

<b>Joshua Crotts</b>. June 2020.<em> The Optimization of Largely-Populated Emitters in Particle Systems.</em> Individual Undergraduate Research. University of North Carolina at Greensboro (Unpublished and Incomplete).
	<UL>
		<LI>My current research (along with the rhetorical natural language project) consists of optimizing particle systems that are typically limited by dynamicly-allocated data structures such as ArrayLists. I introduce several algorithms that attempt to improve performance and increase overhead for more complex and higher quantity particles.</LI>

<b>Joshua Crotts</b>.<em> Binary Space Partitioning - A Focus on Rendering and Compression Algorithms.</em> University of North Carolina at Greensboro (Unpublished).
	<UL>
		<LI>In my graduate algorithm analysis course, we had to write a research paper investigating some advanced topic in algorithms. Being that I enjoy computer graphics and video games, I chose binary space partitioning, which plays part in both rendering and compression. I also studied several algorithms that cope with partially-ambiguous polygons by splitting them at some point. Lastly, I worked with Andrew Matzureff to explain various rendering methods that, while are not mathematically proven, provide good future research potential. Note that this paper is not published.</LI>
